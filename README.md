## Overview

This is a starter template using the following stack:

- Framework - [Next.js (App Router)](https://nextjs.org)
- Language - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- Auth - [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev)
- Database - [Postgres](https://vercel.com/postgres)
- Deployment - [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/next.js/overview)
- Styling - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- Components - [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- Analytics - [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics)
- Formatting - [Prettier](https://prettier.io)

## Features

- **Dynamic Menu System**: Menu items are loaded from the database and filtered based on user roles and permissions
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Users can be assigned different roles (admin, manager, user) with different menu access
- **Secure Server-Side Filtering**: Menu authorization happens on the server for better security
- **Mock Data Mode**: Work on the frontend without database setup - perfect for UI development and prototyping

This template uses the new Next.js App Router. This includes support for enhanced layouts, colocation of components, tests, and styles, component-level data fetching, and more.

## Mock Data Mode

The application now supports a **mock data mode** that allows you to run and develop the application without setting up a database. This is perfect for:

- Frontend development and prototyping
- UI/UX testing without database dependencies
- Quick demos and presentations
- Learning the application structure

When `POSTGRES_URL` is not configured in your `.env` file, the application automatically uses mock data for:
- **Products**: 12 sample products with images, prices, and stock information
- **Menu Items**: All 5 default menu items (Dashboard, Orders, Products, Customers, Analytics)
- **Pagination**: Fully functional pagination with mock data
- **Search**: Search functionality works with mock product names

To use mock data mode, simply leave `POSTGRES_URL` commented out or unset in your `.env` file.

## Getting Started

### Deploying to Vercel

This application is optimized for seamless deployment on Vercel:

1. **Deploy to Vercel** - Click the "Deploy" button or import your GitHub repository
2. **Add Postgres Database** - During deployment, Vercel will prompt you to create a new Postgres database
3. **Configure Auth** - Set up your GitHub OAuth application and add the required environment variables:
   - `AUTH_GITHUB_ID` - Your GitHub OAuth App Client ID
   - `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET` - Your GitHub OAuth App Client Secret
   - `AUTH_SECRET` - Generate at [generate-secret.vercel.app/32](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32)
4. **Deploy** - Complete the deployment and your app will be live!

**The application now automatically creates tables and seeds initial data on first run!** You no longer need to manually run SQL scripts or seed endpoints. Database initialization happens automatically on the first request, not during build time, ensuring reliable deployments.

### Local Development

#### Option 1: Quick Start with Mock Data (No Database Required)

For frontend development without database setup:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Update the `.env` file with minimal configuration (leave `POSTGRES_URL` commented out):
```bash
# POSTGRES_URL=  # Leave this commented out to use mock data

NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here  # Generate at https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32
AUTH_GITHUB_ID=your-github-id
AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET=your-github-secret
```

3. Install dependencies and start the development server:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application will automatically use **mock data** for products and menu items, allowing you to see and work with the frontend without setting up a database.

#### Option 2: Full Setup with Database

For production or full-featured development:

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the values. Follow the instructions in the `.env.example` file to set up your GitHub OAuth application.

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel link
vercel env pull
```

Finally, run the following commands to start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

You should now be able to access the application at http://localhost:3000.

### What Happens Automatically

When you first access the application (either locally or on Vercel):

1. **Database tables are created automatically** - On the first request that requires database access, the system checks if required tables exist and creates them if needed
2. **Initial data is seeded automatically** - Default roles (admin, manager, user) and menu items are populated on first database access
3. **Users are auto-assigned a role** - New users are automatically assigned the "user" role on first login
4. **No manual setup required** - Just configure your database connection and OAuth, then deploy or run!
5. **Build-time safe** - Database initialization only happens at runtime, never during the build process, ensuring reliable Vercel deployments

### Optional: Manual Role Assignment

If you want to give yourself admin access instead of the default user role:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/assign-role \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userEmail": "your-github-email@example.com", "roleId": 1}'
```

### Legacy Setup (No Longer Required)

The following steps are **no longer necessary** but are kept for reference:

<details>
<summary>Old manual setup instructions (click to expand)</summary>

Inside the Vercel Postgres dashboard, create a table based on the schema defined in this repository.

```
CREATE TYPE status AS ENUM ('active', 'inactive', 'archived');

CREATE TABLE products (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  image_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  status status NOT NULL,
  price NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  stock INTEGER NOT NULL,
  available_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

Then, uncomment `app/api/seed.ts` and hit `http://localhost:3000/api/seed` to seed the database with products.

### Menu and Permissions Setup (Old Method)

The application now includes a dynamic menu system based on user roles. To set it up manually:

1. Run the SQL migration script `database-migration.sql` in your database, or
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000/api/seed-menu` to initialize the menu system

Then assign your GitHub user email to a role:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/assign-role \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userEmail": "your-github-email@example.com", "roleId": 1}'
```

For detailed setup instructions, see [MENU_SETUP.md](MENU_SETUP.md).
